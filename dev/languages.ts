                    `Hofplein Fountain</br> This fountain in the middle of traffic square ‘Hofplein’ was presented to the city by shipping company Van Ommeren when the company existed 100 years. The fountain is nicknamed FLIPSPUIT (Flip’s fountainhead) after Philip (Flip) van Ommeren.</br>The fountain has become the place where the people of Rotterdam celebrate their big successes, like the championship of Feyenoord or a victorious game by the Dutch national soccerteam. Supporters tend to jump into the fountain to celebrate.`,
                    `Central Station</br> The current station was officially opened on March 13 2014 by king Willem-Alexander. The design of the station won multiple international awards. The locals, however, gave is a less flattering name. It made them think of the aluminium tray in which they serve their infamous fast food invention: KAPSALON (dish with shawarma, fries and cheese).`,
                    `Feyenoord Stadium</br> Not one, not two, but three professional soccer clubs represent the city of Rotterdam. Feyenoord Stadium is located on the south bank. Supporters lovingly call it the ‘KUIP’ (the tub), because that’s what is looks like from a bird’s eye view. `,
                    `Corporate Entity (sculpture)</br> This artwork used to adorn the entrance of one of the locations of the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (Location Museumpark), then headquarters of Unilever. When the multinational moved to a new building the sculpture, often referred to as SCHROOTHOOP (heap of scrap), moved with them.`,
                    `Erasmus Bridge</br> The inhabitants of Rotterdam invented more than 20 nicknames for their beloved iconic bridge. The ZWAAN (the swan) is the most common one.`,
                    `Blaak Station</br> The architect was asked to make sure travelers would easily find their way to entrance of the underground train and subway station. That resulted in a remarkable construction that shows some likeness with a flying saucer. Others recognize a withered sunflower or…and you need some more imagination for this one: a FLUITKETEL (tea kettle).`,
                    `Erasmus Medical Centre</br> Several smaller hospitals and clinics merged with the faculty of medicine of the Erasmus University to become the Erasmus Medical Centre. When you look at it from a distance it looks like a big, white, square tower. Some call it the refrigerator or KOELKAST.`,
                    `Binnenrotte Square</br> A market with fresh produce is held every Tuesday and Saturday. This square also hosts many events during the year. Archeological excavations on this spot have found the earliest settlements on the riverside of the Rotte, the beginning of Rotterdam. The Binnenrotte is a big open space. That gave it its nickname LANDINGSBAAN (airport runway).`,
                    `Market Hall</br> This paradise of fresh products, delicacies and food stands sees a lot of tourists, many of whom come to see one thing: the ceiling. The immense artwork gave the building its nickname SIXTIJNSE KAPEL (Sixteen Chapel) `,
                    `Central Library</br> The remarkeble yellow tubes on the outside of this building make people think more of a GASFABRIEK (gas factory) than a library. Like many other buildings in town the exterior of the building is decorated with a quote form a famous inhabitant, the humanist thinker Desiderius Erasmus: “Heel de aarde is je vaderland” (The whole world is your homeland). You can visit the Erasmus Experience to learn more about him. `,
                    `Beurstraverse</br> A shopping alley below streetlevel that crosses the Coolsingel. Nobody knows its real name. People just call it the KOOPGOOT (buying gutter)…`,
                    `Blaak Tower</br> Residential towel near Blaak Station. Do you understand why people call it the Pencil (POTLOOD)?`,
                    `Stylized Flower (Sculpture)</br> This originally nameless artwork was a gift of the Bijenkorf (Mall) to the city. It was later given the title ‘Stylized Flower’. Some locals just call it the ‘Thing’ of, more original: the traincrash (SPOORWEGONGELUK) `,

Using them will add 5 minutes to your time, though. So think wisely before you open them.</br></br>• Work together. By now you probably started a videocall on MS Teams. If not, start one now and invite your team members. It’s important to communicate. Share your ideas, intuitions and possible answers with the team. This way you'll get the best result. In MS Teams you can use ‘screen share’ so everybody can look at the same screen. But maybe all members want to go to introgame.hr.nl separately so they can all have a look simultaniously. Find out what works for your team! In short: work together to tackle the assignments efficiently!</br></br>• The game has three parts. Between each part you can pause for a break.

Deze Hofpleinfontein werd in 1939 aan de stad Rotterdam geschonken door de rederij Van Ommeren die zijn honderjarige bestaan vierde. De fontein wordt in de volksmond ook wel de Flipspuit genoemd, verwijzend naar Philippus "Flip" van Ommeren. Door de centrale ligging, pal naast de Coolsingel, is het een plaats geworden waar grote successen worden gevierd van voetbalclub Feyenoord en het Nederlands voetbalelftal.

                    </br>Stel: Je gaat om elf uur naar bed en je staat om zeven uur weer op om naar de hogeschool te gaan. In het weekend ga je vaak wat later naar bed, maar slaap je ook net zoveel uit. Je hebt 0:45 uur reistijd van huis naar school, een half uur om aan te kleden en te eten 's ochtend. Op school heb je van maandag t/m donderdag les van 8.30 uur tot 10:10 uur en je hebt les 12:10 tot 13.50 uur. Vrijdag heb je ook les, maar die volg je online via Teams. Naast je lessen besteed je nog 4 uur per dag aan huiswerk. Dat doe je vaak efficiënt tussen de lessen door, hoef je minder 's avonds en in het weekend te doen. Je kookt je eigen eten, kost een half uurtje en tja, binnen 20 minuten heb je dat op. Per week werk je gemiddeld 14 uur in een leuk koffietentje in de stad. Je wilt het eigenlijk niet, maar aan social media ben je bijna anderhalf uur per dag kwijt. Oh ja, en je belt natuurlijk elke week een keer met je ouders (of oma/opa/tante) voor zo'n 30 min.

Maar: let wel goed op welke informatie je krijgt toegespeeld… je zou dat zomaar eens nodig kunnen hebben op een later moment in het spel (en natuurlijk tijdens je studie ;-) )</br></br>• Tijdens het spel kan je gebruik maken van hints. Het gebruik van de hints kost je echter tijd. Hoe minder hints jullie nodig hebben, hoe beter!</br></br>• Werk samen. Als het goed is zijn jullie inmiddels als groep een videogesprek gestart in MS Teams. Zorg dat je goed communiceert. Deel je ideeën, vermoedens en mogelijke antwoorden hardop met elkaar. Zo kom je samen tot het beste resultaat. In MS Teams kan je ervoor kiezen om je scherm te delen met de andere mensen in de groep. Dan kijkt iedereen naar hetzelfde scherm. Daarnaast is het natuurlijk ook mogelijk om allemaal individueel via de link https://introgame.hr.nl  het spel te doorlopen. Op die manier kan iedereen mee op zoek naar antwoorden. Kortom, bundel je krachten en verdeel de taken slim!</br></br>• Het spel bestaat uit 3 delen. Tussen de delen kan je wel even pauzeren, maar sluit het spel niet af. Tijdens jullie pauze loopt de tijd niet verder door.</br></br>En nu op naar een geweldige studententijd!</br>Veel speelplezier!`,
